## 🚀 Project Overview
The **AI-Powered Inventory Forecast System** is an intelligent web application that leverages **time series forecasting** and **machine learning** to help businesses predict inventory demand, optimize stock levels, and make data-driven decisions.  

With this system, users can:
- Forecast hourly inventory demand using historical data.
- Upload any CSV dataset to predict outputs using machine learning.
- Get **smart reorder suggestions** based on predicted demand.
- Visualize predictions with **interactive dashboards**.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

### 1. Inventory Forecasting
- Uses **Prophet** for accurate time series predictions.
- Supports **hourly, daily, and weekly seasonality**.
- Interactive plots with **Plotly**.
- Provides **forecast metrics**: Last Hour Demand, Average Demand, Forecast Horizon.

### 2. Smart CSV Predictor
- Upload any CSV dataset and predict outputs automatically.
- **Detects task type** (classification or regression).
- Uses **Random Forest** for high-performance predictions.
- Displays model performance metrics:
  - Accuracy (classification)
  - R² Score (regression)

### 3. AI-Driven Decision Support
- Recommends **reorder quantity** based on forecasted demand.
- Flags urgency levels: **High / Moderate / Safe Stock**.
- Treats negative forecasts realistically (as 0 units).
